INSTALLATION

Before running Sam, you'll need several libraries. The core requirements are
ZeroMQ, and the python daemon library:

$ sudo apt-get install python-zmq
$ sudo apt-get install python-daemon

The TinkerForge brick APIs (used for collecting sensor data, like temperature,
humidity, and light levels) require a daemon downloaded from the TinkerForge
website, which depends on Twisted, GUDev, and libusb:

$ sudo apt-get install python-twisted python-gudev libusb-1.0-0
$ wget http://download.tinkerforge.com/tools/brickd/linux/brickd_linux_latest.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i brickd_linux_latest.deb

If you want to do web scraping (for collecting weather information) install
BeautifulSoup:

$ sudo apt-get install python-beautifulsoup

For voice recognition, install PocketSphinx:

$ sudo apt-get install python-pocketsphinx gstreamer0.10-pocketsphinx

USAGE

Sam can be started directly from the source directory with the command:

  make testrun
